# Fibonacci sequence calculation
# Calculate fib(10) = 55
# Uses R1 for counter, R2 for current, R3 for previous, R4 for result

# Initialize: R1 = 10 (counter), R2 = 1 (current), R3 = 0 (previous)
MOV R1 R1  # Placeholder - will be set by test harness
MOV R2 R2  # Placeholder
MOV R3 R3  # Placeholder

# Simple test: Just do some ALU operations
ADD R4 R2  # R4 = R2
ADD R4 R3  # R4 = R2 + R3

# Return
RET
